- Open source monitoring and alertimng tool
- ALthogh can be used to monitor non containerized infra
- but over the past years main stream monitoring tool of choice in containers and microservices architecture
- pull based mechanism (Being pull-based means that the prometheus server pulls metrics from targets (your infrastructure and applications) rather than infrastructure and applications pushing metrics data to Prometheus.)
- uses its own query language that is PROMQL
- For POD level monitoring -> Kubestate metrics
- Node exporter -> Node level monitoring
- scrape config 
- Prometheus typically uses an HTTP endpoint

WHY?
Moderm devops is becoming more and more complex with lenthy CICD pipe lines that have services strictly dependent on one anothger
where in failure of one service can lead a huge disaster 
So when application is down and you need to figure out quickly that among thousands of pods which one is exactly having error
Monitoring is very useful

SCenario
One of the servers went low on memory and kicked off a running conatiner that was responsible for 
providing database sync btw two database pods 
= two database failed
Application cannot authenbticate users 
= end users will only see unable to authenticate error 

So now we will check everythging backwards which will take a lot of time

BUt what would make this process faster is if we had a continous monitoring tool
that would tell us that a particular pod jhas crashed
or even better if it could tell that the server might be low on memory

Prometheus ARchitecture

Core it has Prometheus Servere
- Data Retrieval worker
- Time SSeries DB
- HTTP server that recieves requests to see that data

Many services dont have native prometheus endpoint 
So they require and exporter
example - if we want to monitor a linux server then download the exporter file untar it and execute

What makes Prometheus so special is that uses a pull mechanism rather than a push mechanism like in New Relic and Cloudwatch
This makes Prometheus suitable for container monitoring
because if it push mechanism daemon needs to be installed on thousands of conatoners and the contaioners would flood the Prometheus srever with metrics
